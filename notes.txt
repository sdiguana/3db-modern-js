------------ Basics of running node -------------
typing "node" in a folder provides access to the REPL, which is like the console.
CTRL+C twice to exit the repl (doesnt close the cmd window)
typing "code ./" in cmd opens VS Code and sets a project in the current directory (the ./ portion)
can type "node index.js" to run the file specified
node can run directories, index.js is the default file (can be over-written)
"node ." runs the directory
------------
------------ Node Modules (Common JS) -------------
require("./calculator"); the ./ is needed for rel pathing
this is a synchronous loader
case sensitivity doesnt matter on windows, but DOES MATTER on other systems
running require again will not run it again, it is cached on the first load
------------
------------ Node example 1 -------------
javascript is a single-thread language
async process will continue running even if the program reaches the end of the script
